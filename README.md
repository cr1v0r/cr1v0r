# Welcome to CR1V0R's Junkyard 👁️‍🗨️

<!--
  To get the red animated glitch effect on top: put an animated GIF named `header-glitch.gif` in this repo
  (or replace the path below with a hosted GIF). GitHub READMEs can't run arbitrary CSS, so a GIF is the safest way.

## What I (claim to) know

Below is a short, no-bs list of the tools and languages I tinker with in the digital underbrush:

- **Linux** — I live in terminals and sleep in tmux sessions.
- **Python** — scripting chaos, one `import` at a time.
- **C** — because sometimes you need your program to fear you back.
- **SQL** — I like my joins like I like my plots: uncontrolled.

(Yeah, I know more than this. But I prefer mystery.)

  Notes for editing:
  - Replace `header-glitch.gif` with a red-glitch animated GIF to achieve the top effect.
  - Replace `donald-counting-money.gif` with the Donald Duck GIF you want (or a hosted URL).
  - This file is written in English as requested and keeps a playful / mocking tone.
