## 🧠 What I (claim to) know

Below is a short, no-bs list of the tools and languages I tinker with in the digital underbrush:

- **Linux** — I live in terminals and sleep in tmux sessions.  
- **Python** — scripting chaos, one `import` at a time.  
- **C** — because sometimes you need your program to fear you back.  
- **SQL** — I like my joins like I like my plots: uncontrolled.  

(Yeah, I know more than this. But I prefer mystery.)
