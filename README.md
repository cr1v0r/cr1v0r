## 🧠 WHO THE HELL IS CR1V0R?

I'm the ghost in your packet logs.  
The one who laughs while the system burns.  
They call me **CR1V0R**, not because I’m evil — but because chaos runs smoother with root access.  

I live somewhere between `/dev/null` and a caffeine overdose.  
I break stuff, fix it, then break it again — just to prove I can.  
If you’re reading this, you’re either curious, lost, or both.  

Either way... welcome to the junkyard.

## ⚙️ What I (actually) know

You don’t need a list to know power, but fine — here’s a glimpse:  

- **Linux** — My comfort zone. Bash is my second language.  
- **Python** — Automating everything, even my sarcasm.  
- **C** — Because sometimes you want to talk directly to the machine.  
- **SQL** — I speak fluent database.  
- **HTML/CSS/JS** — Yeah, I can make things *look* pretty too.  
- **Cybersecurity** — Exploit, patch, repeat.  
- **Networking** — If it connects, I can control it.  

I don’t just “code.” I **build**, **break**, **learn**, and **repeat** — faster than your antivirus can say *“false positive.”*

## 🧩 My Philosophy

> “Information wants to be free.  
>  But first, it wants to be encrypted.”

I don’t believe in perfection — only improvement.  
I see firewalls as puzzles and vulnerabilities as opportunities.  
I learn from chaos, and I teach through irony.  

People think hackers are villains.  
Truth is, we’re the janitors of the digital world —  
Cleaning up your insecure mess, one exploit at a time.

## ⚡ Tools of the Trade

- Arch Linux (btw)  
- Burp Suite  
- Nmap  
- Wireshark  
- Metasploit  
- Vim (of course)  
- Too much coffee ☕  

If you know, you know.

## 📂 Projects (a.k.a experiments gone right)

- **JunkOS** — a cursed minimal Linux build that only I can love.  
- **P4ND0RA** — my Python-based recon framework that doesn’t like being stared at.  
- **GhostTrack** — real-time network mapping tool (with attitude).  
- **CR1Vault** — my private exploit archive (and no, you can’t see it).

## 🪞 Fun Facts (you didn’t ask for)

- I once tried to hack my own microwave. It bricked itself in fear.  
- I write code faster when listening to synthwave.  
- I believe “404” is just the universe’s way of saying “try harder.”  
- I drink coffee like it’s a programming language.
